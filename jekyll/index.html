    <header><h2>Vision</h2></header>
    <p>
      Within the next five years, DASA will maintain and support vigorous and
      growing Drupal Communities in the major centres. DASA will have developed
      and cultivated a desire within Business, Government and Institutions of
      Learning for knowledge of the superior functionality and security features
      in Drupal. Five years thereafter, DASA will host the first DrupalCon on
      the African continent.
