DrupalAssociationSA.github.io
=============================

The official DASA Github pages site.

### Running locally

The dasa.org.za site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://dasa.org.za>. The site may also be run locally.

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v1.x).
2. From the root `/DrupalAssociationSA.github.io` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
  - **Windows users:** run `chcp 65001` first to change the command prompt's character encoding ([code page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page)) to UTF-8 so Jekyll runs without errors.
3. Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
